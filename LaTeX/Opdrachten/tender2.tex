Even though my preference for tender goes out to the project of ``Visual Recognition to Conserve Nature'', atomisation in the educational field is also an interest of mine.

In the past few years I have worked as a Teaching Assistant (TA) and Tutor for the BSc KI. One of the problems that I would like to see solved is that the grading of the assignments of the students takes a lot of time. An automated grading process would therefore be something I would like to see in the near future.

To accomplice an automatic grading system, my approach would be to do it the other way around. First develop a system that can make questions for the students to answer. The reason for this approach is that my prediction is that when a question can be formalised from a knowledge based system, it is easyer to also develop a way to understand the given answer.

Before a system like the one described here can exist, there is also need for more understanding of natural language processing. However, my focus on this project would be the knowledge system.
