This project tried to begin the build of autonomous agents that could clean up the ocean of plastic.
An agent was not build, however a sizable start was made with the vision of such an agent.
Several state-of-the-art algorithms were used on a dataset of images containing floating plastic, animals, both or none to classify the images in one of the classes.
One of the algorithms -- the Feed Foreward Network -- trained on the second-to-last layer of a Convolutional Neural Network, did not work satisfactory.

There are several possible reasons the Feed Forward Network used in this project did not perform well.
Because the implementation was not part of a \texttt{Python} library, there could be bugs.
This however does not seem probable, because the implementation was tested with a xor dataset which performed properly.

More likely is the normalisation of the data.
The second-to-last layer of the CNN was not normalised, while the FNN implementation used ${tanh}()$ to approximate the Sigmoid function.
However, even a normalisation of the data did not affect the outcome.
Bottom-line, the network was not able to learn the classes from the data.

The accurate results of the Support Vector Machine could be expected.
SVMs are known to work well in high dimensional data, as long as the amount of classes to be trained on is small.
The 4096 vector of the second-to-last layer of the CNN only needed to be trained on two classes, for which both had an SVM trained on ether showing or not.

This project is one of the many recent projects that show the possibilities with Convolutional Neural Networks.
Besides that, it also shows how the Artificial Intelligence can be used to help solving environmental problems.
I do not think the hippie movement in the 60s could imagine that AI could solve their problems for them today.
