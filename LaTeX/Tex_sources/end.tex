\begin{tabular}{ p{0.2\textwidth } | p{0.8\textwidth } }
abbrivation & meaning \\ \hline
type & which type of model used for the fitting hyperplane; poly mean polynomial, where the last digit stands for the degree; rbf is gaussian, where the last digit stands for gamma \\
Ttrain & the amount of time in seconds the complete training took \\
Ttest & the amount of time in seconds the complete testing took \\
Dsize & the amount of data-points used for training the model \\
Vsize & the amount of data-points used for testing the model \\
Bco & the amount of test-points that were correct\footnote{correct means here having the same output as the label, so both \texttt{11} and \texttt{00} are considered correct i.e. an iff} on both classes \\
Pco & the amount of test-points that were correct only on the plastic class \\
Aco & the amount of test-points that were correct only on the animal class \\
Bac & the accuracy on both classes i.e. $\frac{Bco}{Vsize}$ \\
Pac & the accuracy on the plastic class i.e. $\frac{Bco+Pco}{Vsize}$ \\
Aac & the accuracy on the animals class i.e. $\frac{Bco+Aco}{Vsize}$
